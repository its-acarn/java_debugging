Answer the following questions:

What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
How do we debug the next line of code?
What does the step into command do?
What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?

1. A breakpoint is where the user marks a point in the code to signify where the debugger is to start.
2. No.
3. Use the 'step over' method command
4. 'Step into' jumps into a method and will pause at the start of it for you to proceed.
5. 'Evaluate Expression' allows you to execute one line of java code at that point in the code where the breakpoint has been made. 'Evaluate Code Fragment'
allows more than one line of java code to be executed and tested.
